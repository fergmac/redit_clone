# REDit Clone

![Alt text](./screenshots/redit_screenshot.png "REDit Clone")

Create a Product Hunt / Reddit clone that transforms existing data into a view using posts and categories.

The project must includes imported data (from a JSON file),  React and the Material UI library to build out the application's UI, 
Redux and react-redux to manage application state, and React Router for routing.

I got stuck trying to get my routing to work for the popular and newest URL's i spent most of my time trying to get those to work
and working my way back to a place where my app worked. Currently my upVotes are working onClick. I think there a few areas of confusion
for me between my PostList and my post reducer that if I could clear up I would better understand what to do next. 

Currently i have this error:

warning.js:36Warning: Failed prop type: Invalid prop `component` supplied to `Route`.
    in Route

but I can't narrow down anything wrong with my routes in react.app.js

I also plan on customizing the content of my app but I wanted to get my sorting working before I continue with that
